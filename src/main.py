@brief      The main orchestrator for the GIBCA 2025 interactive sculpture.

@details    This script manages the core AI conversation loop, integrating modules
            for voice transcription, sentiment analysis, language synthesis (LLM),
            and voice synthesis (TTS). It will eventually be triggered by
            serial events from the firmware.
